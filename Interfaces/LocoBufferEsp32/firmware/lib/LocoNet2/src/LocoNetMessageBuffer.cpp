 * Title :   LocoNet Buffer Source Code file
 * Author:   Alex Shepherd <kiwi64ajs@sourceforge.net>
 * Date:     13-Feb-2004
 * Software:  AVR-GCC
 * Target:    AtMega8
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 * This module provides functions that manage the receiving of
 * LocoNet packets.
 *
 * 	As bytes are received from the LocoNet, they are stored in a circular
 * 	buffer and after a valid packet has been received it can be read out.
 *
 * 	Statistics of packets and errors maintained.
 *
 * 	Any invalid packets that are received are discarded and the stats are
 * 	updated approproately.
 *
