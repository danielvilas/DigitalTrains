 * 	DESCRIPTION
 * 	This module provides functions that manage the sending and receiving of LocoNet packets.
 *
 * 	As bytes are received from the LocoNet, they are stored in a circular
 * 	buffer and after a valid packet has been received it can be read out.
 *
 * 	When packets are sent successfully, they are also appended to the Receive
 * 	circular buffer so they can be handled like they had been received from
 * 	another device.
 *
 * 	Statistics are maintained for both the send and receiving of packets.
 *
 * 	Any invalid packets that are received are discarded and the stats are
 * 	updated approproately.
