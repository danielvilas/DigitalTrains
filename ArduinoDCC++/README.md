# Arduino DCC++ Board
This board is designed to have the arduino core and the motor shield on one single board. 
One objective is to study the pinout change of the motor shield for DCC++

## Status
Deprecated, The new Dcc++EX project have an updated pinout that solves the need of this board. Also, for the shake of the price, this board has been separated on several independent boards, under [DccBlock](../DccBlocks) project.
