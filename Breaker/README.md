# Breaker
Based on an circuit of [rpaisley](http://www.circuitous.ca/CircuitIndex.html). This is a DC current breaker, if it is to high there is a short and cuts the DC in power (before speed control)

## Status
Frozen, With DCC the central handles the Shorts detections and current break.

This could be usefull in a Power Distribution Circuit.
