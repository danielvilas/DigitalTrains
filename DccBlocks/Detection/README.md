# On Track Detectors
Sensors to detect Rolling Stock on tracks

## Locomotive Detectors (DCC)
Current compsution Circuits to detect the presence of locomotives on track, also can detect wagons/cars that have some kind of current ussage (leds, resistors, accesory decoder,...)

* __[SMD Analogic and Digital](Locos/Detector_SMD_AD)__: Sensor with Digital Ouput and Analogic proportional to the current ussage.
* __[SMD Simple](Locos/Detector_SMD_Simple)__: Minimum Detector with digital output.

## Documents
On the [Documents](Doc) folder are some schematics found public on the internet, cited and used on the creation of this circuits, they have their own author, check them if you need.

## Simulation
Inside [Simulation](Simulation) there are Kicad Schematics for use with the simulation tool (ngspice). Used to understand the circuits and create the boards.
